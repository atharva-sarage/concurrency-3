Aim: Extend the game of 'LodeRunner' to a two-player setting. We name the game
as 'NodeRunner'.
LodeRunner: https://www.crazygames.com/game/lode-runner
Implementation:
C++ SFML-gaming library.
golang for server-side computations using golang websocket library.
Phaser - a JavaScript library for User Interface.

Details: We aim at creating a game 'NodeRunner'. Unlike its counterpart
'LodeRunner', it is a two-player game. It shares the same background with
'LodeRunner'. A player aims at sustaining his health before other one
runs out of health. Health of a player decreases with time. Gems are placed
at certain locations. Every gem can either improve one's health or decrease
other's health. Health of both players are updated in parallel. If P1 acquires
a gem that halves P2's health, then we don't want the operation of halving health
to be overwritten by the operation of regularly reducing the health by 1. The
problem can be solved by using a mutex.
Like LodeRunner it will also have Bots that aim to kill the players. Players
protect themselves away from them. The Bots are run using Dijkstra's algorithm
to find the shortest path from a Bot to nearest player. The Bots can be
dropped into holes created by player. After a certain time, a Bot comes out
of the hole.
